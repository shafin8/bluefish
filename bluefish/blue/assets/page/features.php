<h2 align="right">Brood stock:</h2>
 <p align="right">The key to successful agriculture-aquaculture production is the use of improved, genetically selected strains. Classical genetic selection methods (excluding genetic engineering methods) are used to select for advantageous ‘Economic Traits’ of different types of fishes. In Blue Fish Hatchery only male population is raised, to avoid wild-spawning and the small size of females. Most growers use hormones to convert female fry to male fry. Our ND 21and ND 41 hybrids are All-Male without hormonal treatment. This is the key to organic fish farming.

<h2>Spawning:</h2>

<img src="../img/feature/b.png"hspace="10"  vspace="10" alt="Mountain View" align="right" style="width:500px;height:320px;">
<p> Efficient delivery of high quality feeds to your fish or shrimp farming operation is critical to success. With the cost of feeding shrimp and fish typically exceeding 50% of total production costs, operating at the highest levels of efficiency are absolutely critical. Working in close collaboration with some of the best aquatic feed mills around the world, our aquatic nutrition expert is ready to develop superior feeds that will reduce overall feed costs and dramatically improve operating margins.

<img src="../img/feature/c.jpg" hspace="10"  vspace="10"alt="Mountain View" align="left" style="width:500px;height:320px;">
<p align="right"> Feed quality can be very important for both fish and pond health. The feed that you use can help your fish to have better colour, grow more quickly, and stay healthier. We carry a wide variety of feeds that are suited to both lined to different ponds and larger trout ponds.

<h2> Larvae: </h2>

<img src="../img/feature/d.jpg" hspace="10"  vspace="10"alt="Mountain View" align="right" style="width:500px;height:320px;">
<p>The larvae perform the first process in our operation, turning one hundred and ten tonnes per day of organic food waste into a loamy soil enhancer, MagSoil™. The process is similar to that in a domestic worm bin, except at an industrial scale and lightning speed!
Each day we harvest and separate the mature larvae from the MagSoil™ and set to work sterilising, processing and preparing the larvae into the world’s most sustainable and natural animal proteinfor use in agricultural feed preparations.

<p align="right">Live shellfish(800-1,000 g each) are harvested from grow out ponds daily, and transferred ALIVE in water, to purging ponds adjacent to the Processing Plant. Large shellfish fish will pass through the Processing Equipment Line, under perfect hygienic conditions to ensure highest product quality and safety.

<h2>Feed Consumption: </h2>


<img src="../img/feature/f.jpg" hspace="10"  vspace="10"alt="Mountain View" align="right" style="width:500px;height:320px;">
<p>Providing fish a nutritionally balanced diet is essential to grow a healthy stock of fish. In terms of fish farming, the variety of fish feed must be carefully considered because feed represents 50% of the production cost. 
There are many different types of freshwater fish feed readily available today. One can provide a variety of food for their fish depending on their individual feeding requirements. While some aquarium fish may be able to survive on a limited variety of food, this does not necessarily mean that they are living up to their full potential. A wide variety of quality food within the species’ feeding parameter is beneficial for the long term health of the fish.

<p align="right"> Disease prevention, disease diagnosis, and disease management are cornerstones of best management practices in aquaculture.  
 Our team can design and implement a biosecure system of health management and disease prevention for any commercial fish farming or shrimp farming operation. We take an integrated approach to disease prevention and control; an approach that integrates strict biosecurity, system design, genetic selection, use of specific pathogen free (SPF) animals, use of high quality feeds, superior water quality management methods, and overall best management practices for fish and shrimp culture.

<h2>Eggs in Stock:</h2>

<img src="../img/feature/g.jpg"hspace="10"  vspace="10" alt="Mountain View" align="right" style="width:500px;height:320px;">
 <p>Although the fishes breed freely in ponds, it is important for farmers (producers) to consider using properly produced fingerlings. They need to invest in hatcheries for fry and fingerling production. Quality fingerlings in tilapia aquaculture are very important. For this reason it is advisable for farmers to generate their own fingerlings if they cannot ascertain the quality of those from other sources. Poor fingerlings result in poor harvests.

<h2 align="right">Fishes in Farms:</h2>


<img src="../img/feature/h.jpg" hspace="10"  vspace="10"alt="Mountain View" align="left" style="width:500px;height:320px;"><p align="right"> Fish stocking is an important part of any lake management program. The choice of fish to stock depends on the lake owner’s goals and size of the body of water. Large lakes may be hard to manage, but it is also difficult to manage a pond of less than one-acre for species such as bass and bluegill. The most common strategy for pond and lake stocking is to combine largemouth bass and bluegill (and/or redeared sunfish). The bluegill will reproduce and grow rapidly with the abundant food and provide excellent forage for bass. As long as bass are not over-harvested they will keep bluegill from overpopulating. However, some large bluegill will survive bass predation and in turn provide excellent bluegill angling.

<p> Blue Fish Hatchery performs economic and financial projections for Tilapia fish farming projects. The results are incorporated in a Business Plan and presented in a Bankable format facilitating the interactions with investors, financing sources and regulatory entities. The Business Plan is prepared for a specific site, with specific production goals in mind. Preliminary data is collected by you, based on Data Collection Manual and Guideline for Site Selection provided by the company. Detailed data regarding site conditions and local economic parameters are gathered by a team of experts during site visitation. Site inspection includes thorough examination of climatic
